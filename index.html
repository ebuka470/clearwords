            "response": "My guy is a friendly, casual term for a friend or acquaintance, similar to 'bro' or 'mate.' It expresses camaraderie and familiarity. You might hear 'How now, my guy?' as a friendly greeting between peers. It's used for both males and females in informal settings."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does i'm coming mean, im coming meaning, i'm coming nigeria, coming soon meaning",
            "response": "I'm coming rarely means immediate arrival. It usually means 'I'll be there soon' or 'I'm on my way but not immediately.' This could mean anything from 5 minutes to an hour. It's a polite way of acknowledging your request without committing to an exact time. Don't panic if someone says this and doesn't appear immediately."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "why are people late to events, nigerian time, african time, late meetings nigeria",
            "response": "The concept of 'African time' or 'Nigerian time' means events often start later than scheduled. This isn't considered rude in social contexts—it accounts for traffic, multiple commitments, and a more relaxed view of time. For business meetings, arrive on time but be prepared to wait. For parties, coming 1-2 hours late is often expected."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does how far mean, how far meaning, how far nigeria, how far greeting",
            "response": "How far has nothing to do with distance. It's the ultimate Nigerian greeting, meaning 'What's up?' 'How are you?' or 'How's it going?' The expected response is 'I dey' or 'I dey fine' (I'm fine). It's casual and used between friends, colleagues, and acquaintances of similar age."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does see you next tomorrow mean, next tomorrow meaning, day after tomorrow nigeria",
            "response": "Next tomorrow means 'the day after tomorrow.' It's a direct translation from many Nigerian languages that have specific words for 'tomorrow' and 'the day after tomorrow.' So if someone says 'See you next tomorrow,' they mean two days from now, not the immediate tomorrow."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does well done mean, well done meaning, well done nigeria, well done work",
            "response": "Well done isn't just for cooked meat. It's used to praise someone who's working or has accomplished something. You might hear 'Well done, sir!' to a security guard at his post or 'Well done!' to someone cooking. It shows appreciation for effort and hard work."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does sorry mean, sorry meaning nigeria, sorry condolence, sorry greeting",
            "response": "Sorry in Nigeria extends beyond apologies. It's used to express sympathy for any minor discomfort—if you sneeze, trip, look tired, or mention a problem. Respond with 'Thank you' or 'No problem.' It shows empathy rather than admitting fault."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does you're too much mean, you too much meaning, too much compliment",
            "response": "You're too much is a compliment meaning you're impressive, amazing, or exceptionally good at something. If someone says this, they're praising you, not criticizing. The proper response is 'No, you're too much!' in a playful, humble denial."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does i'm on my way mean, on my way nigeria, on my way meaning",
            "response": "I'm on my way could mean anything from 'I'm walking out the door' to 'I'm considering starting to get ready.' It's a polite acknowledgment that you've been remembered and they intend to come, but the timing might be flexible. Always confirm actual arrival times separately."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does no wahala mean, no wahala meaning, wahala meaning, no problem nigeria",
            "response": "No wahala means 'no problem' or 'no trouble.' Wahala means trouble or stress, so 'no wahala' is the Nigerian way of saying 'it's all good,' 'don't worry about it,' or 'you're welcome.' It's used extensively in casual conversations."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does how you dey mean, how you dey meaning, how you dey greeting",
            "response": "How you dey is the pidgin version of 'How are you?' It's more casual than 'How far' and used between friends. The response is usually 'I dey' or 'I dey kampe' (I'm fine and steady). It shows familiarity and comfort with the person."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does na you sabi mean, you sabi meaning, na you sabi response",
            "response": "Na you sabi means 'It's up to you' or 'You know best.' It's used when someone wants you to make a decision or when they're deferring to your judgment. It can be genuine or slightly passive-aggressive depending on context and tone."
        },
        {
            "keyword": "what does abeg mean, abeg meaning, please nigeria, abeg request",
            "response": "Abeg is pidgin for 'please,' but it's used more frequently and in more contexts. It can mean 'please,' 'I beg you,' 'excuse me,' or even 'come on now' when expressing mild frustration. 'Abeg make we go' means 'Please let's go.'"
        },
